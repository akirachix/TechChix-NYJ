            podcast,<br></br>
            where we cover all things robotic in K12 education! Today we have
            the young women ,<br></br>
            who are software Developers, and semi-professional Battle Bot
            makers. We’re going to talk about the<br></br>
            latest news of women in tech and how some of them got started to
            become who they are now.<br></br>
